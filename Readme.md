Encapsulation: It is the process of binding the datamembers and member functions of a class in a single object.

Inheritance: It is the OOP concept which enable a class to reuse the data members and member functions of another class by inheriting it.

Polymorphism: It is the property of OOP to have functions with same name but different bodies and to do different (generally similar) tasks.
It is of 2 types: Runtime polymorphism and compile time polymorphism. 
Compile time polymorphism or function overloading involves functions with same name but different parameter list (function prototype) in the same class.
Runtime polymorphism or function overriding involves functions with same name and prototypes in different classes linked by inheritance.
